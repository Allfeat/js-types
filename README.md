# @allfeat/types

Implementation of the types and their (de-)serialisation via SCALE codec. On the Rust side, the codec types and primitive types are implemented via the [parity-codec](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-codec).

They are generated with the @polkadot/typegen package and can be used to augment the polkadot-js API.
