       * The list of thresholds separating the various bags.
       * 
       * Ids are separated into unsorted bags according to their score. This specifies the
       * thresholds separating the bags. An id's bag is the largest bag for which the id's score
       * is less than or equal to its upper threshold.
       * 
       * When ids are iterated, higher bags are iterated completely before lower bags. This means
       * that iteration is _semi-sorted_: ids of higher score tend to come before ids of lower
       * score, but peer ids within a particular bag are sorted in insertion order.
       * 
       * # Expressing the constant
       * 
       * This constant must be sorted in strictly increasing order. Duplicate items are not
       * permitted.
       * 
       * There is an implied upper limit of `Score::MAX`; that value does not need to be
       * specified within the bag. For any two threshold lists, if one ends with
       * `Score::MAX`, the other one does not, and they are otherwise equal, the two
       * lists will behave identically.
       * 
       * # Calculation
       * 
       * It is recommended to generate the set of thresholds in a geometric series, such that
       * there exists some constant ratio such that `threshold[k + 1] == (threshold[k] *
       * constant_ratio).max(threshold[k] + 1)` for all `k`.
       * 
       * The helpers in the `/utils/frame/generate-bags` module can simplify this calculation.
       * 
       * # Examples
       * 
       * - If `BagThresholds::get().is_empty()`, then all ids are put into the same bag, and
       * iteration is strictly in insertion order.
       * - If `BagThresholds::get().len() == 64`, and the thresholds are determined according to
       * the procedure given above, then the constant ratio is equal to 2.
       * - If `BagThresholds::get().len() == 200`, and the thresholds are determined according to
       * the procedure given above, then the constant ratio is approximately equal to 1.248.
       * - If the threshold list begins `[1, 2, 3, ...]`, then an id with score 0 or 1 will fall
       * into bag 0, an id with score 2 will fall into bag 1, etc.
       * 
       * # Migration
       * 
       * In the event that this list ever changes, a copy of the old bags list must be retained.
       * With that `List::migrate` can be called, which will perform the appropriate migration.
